# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis.
creating sql database to analyze mock employee info for retirement benefits

For this part of the Challenge, youâ€™ll write a report to help the manager prepare for the upcoming "silver tsunami."

The analysis should contain the following:

  Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
    Future-proofing the company against the "Silver Tsunami" of employees retiring at the same time by estimating employees eligible for retirement benefits
    
  Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
  - There are a huge number of people eligible for retirement
  - There are nowhere near enough mentor-eligible employees for a traditional 1-to-1 system of mentorship to be effective
  - However, there are only 7 titles retiring
  - While these titles naturally cover many different job responsibilities, it may be possible for mentor-eligible employees to implement a 1-to-many system. Even if it's not a good system, it's almost definitely necessary.
  
  Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
     
   How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
    90,398. Over ninty thousand roles.
    
   Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
    Only if every retiring employee mentors 60 people each... In other words, not even close.
